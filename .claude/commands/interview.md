Read $ARGUMENTS

Then interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious

be very in-depth and continue interviewing me continually until it's complete, then write the specification to the file specified in $ARGUMENTS
